when it comes to private contract. It is, therefore, not viable for us to guarantee the same refund procedure or policies for all tours and services listed on BedLinker website. Accordingly, the following policies apply for:
Tickets: All tickets are non-refundable as well as non-transferrable .
Visa: Fee charged for all types of visas is non-refundable, as the immigration authority of the UAE normally does not refund the amount in the case of rejected visa applications.
Unused Tours: No refund can be made for unused tours, partly used or unutilized part of holiday package. Precisely, such unused services are not exchangeable or refundable.
No Show: BedLinker should not be held liable, if a guest fails to notify our team regarding the cancellation of tour or do not reach on time at the place of commencement of tour. Such cases will be treated as No Show and are non-re -
fundable.
Third party services: Since they are subject to different refund and cancellation policies, some of the services offered by third parties may be non-refundable. We normally provide the details of the same at the time of booking.
