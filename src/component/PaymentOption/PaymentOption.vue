									<b>Floating Cash Deposit:</b> This requires clients to maintain a certain amount of money as floating deposit, as agreed by both parties. As soon as the client makes a reservation, this is deducted from the deposit amount. But reserva -
tions will not be allowed or even cancelled, if the deposit fund is low or insufficient.
<b>Credit Line:</b> Clients can secure a confirmed booking of tours and services with an established credit line. In order to be assigned with a credit line, itâ€™s vital for the clients to abide by the provisions and standards set by BedLinker,
besides maintaining a floating deposit or a bank guarantee from a reputable financial institution.
BedLinker provides a comprehensive suite of travel solutions at a very competitive rate and without any hidden fee / string attached. We also assure our members of excellent technical support and immediate response to their
queries with the best of our knowledge.
